welcome in the senior jimmy dwyer
I want to be as high
coming off the board
getting out far
back to December
they go so fast
go in the water
get on in
next trampoline swinging
working hard
go to dry land
diving at MLK in Silver Spring
do the dives that build up
travel straight down
achieve something diving wise
dive making a half circle
you could have a great jump
do this
you got back here to uncw
you get a lateral
time the board
in the water
make practices interesting
step out of the hurdle
step down very good looking swing
passing through
taking off into a die
continue this
try three different types of entry feet
going in
a little fast there okay right through that quad
the dive underwater
push and throw at
do a hurdle knee
with this swing through here
you're doing things like a somersault
first stand through the board
a back dive tuck
they're doing big
getting away from the board
find a dumpster full of
this dive down into the take-off
they're not looking at the end of
to step down hold
take off,
go back
watch the rangers
be shooting off away from the diving board
initiate the flip
all the way through that helps you
she's unable to
you to obviously carry on this run
they hit high school
I'm in the air
about what's called the hollow position
making it look choppy
take them through the pattern
watch for again those landmark moments
have an amazing setup
they're gonna be a little bit skittish
you reach that stage
our twisting axis
somersaulting action is being developed in the
get to here
he lost
take off a little bit reaching
we're gonna go lunch
bum is too far back on the board
she's rocking
front jump tuck
they handled themselves
you're reaching for the water
they're contributing more pollution
little bit of speed
dive from 10 meters
the inward dive tuck is ultimately
he swings all the way down
look 16 different places
he starts his descent
have a small splash
we had such momentum we
jumping confidently through the board
enter the water straight
hole in the dome dude
you progress on the back
they're coming out of a front dive
look at the entry point
she's pretty
just a little bit further out
tried it on the ground
you're a little bit lean
extending in the hurdle
position the diver
practice on the ground
going from that position
can't visit a loft
going into their hurdle
right there on the water
make notes
knocked off the board
making the opposite rotation
take it slow
make contact
you go into the air
a swim on an
pushes off the board
holds us
took a chance
keep doing
looking at the big picture
Hollow this way hollow just means round
your hurdles is critical
get this stuff loaded up
borrow momentum from the somersault
we're comfortable with this human
pass through the water
one-and-a-half somersault
your descent to the board
stand on a t
on the end of the board
off that shoulder swing now where is
away from the diving board in this safe manner
usually go back somersault
simulate the standing with a hurdle
find something small like this one meter springboard
get that nice close in
a vertical jump of at least 26 or higher
you used to slouch in the chair,
making contact on the water
do a back somersault
you hit the water dam
we're gonna end up with kids
you have to be looking feeling everything
you're at the ideal distance
nice slow big arm circle
in this position
we don't want to be here in
make the move
going into a twist
she pushes
as a high moment of inertia point
start in a pike
pick that up at a garage sale
sit on the bottom of the
he makes contact
she's got a nice compact tuck position
make up the difference speed
see a great back somersault
HAND OUT MEDALS,
do it off of a stack mount
straight up at 12 o'clock
lot of dry land
dive in
leave us with a nice pretty step out line
they jump in
to turn this around
a track start
break your dive down into two steps
we're on the inward dive tuck
we're trying to get really high
make that transition happen
to really ride that board
she's pretty excited about that
with actual full approach

you're about to see
loss of balance
get the kids in
to jump from any height
hitting the board
cause the dive to twist
a nearly perfect front flip of 3 meters
toward the target they touch
into a side view
you approach the board
moving in a straight line
ones out there
do it from five meters
enter the water
end up to the side of the board
the take-off
